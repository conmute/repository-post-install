# Desktop Repository Post Install script collection

I just did this to simplify my reinstalls for home/work purposes

Currently only Ubuntu supports

## What it does:

* Installs:
  * Updage the system
  * Visual Studio Code
  * NVM: Node.js, NPM and NPX
  * Git
  * JRE
  * VLC Media Player
  * Google Chrome
  * Skype
  * Telegram
  * Slack

* Setups:
  * SSH
  * GPG
  * GIT

## ToDo:

* [ ] Avoid repeatables lik in `_install_nvm.sh` file for checks
* [ ] Update structure to enable support for various distros
* [ ] Improve messeging:
  * [ ] Lessen the output, make it more compact and hide success output, but show promts and errors
  * [ ] Add some colors
* [ ] Good error handling resolution
* [ ] Add options installed programes like Telegram to be runned at startup
* [ ] Copy visual look and setup of XFCE desktop (or others) configuration
* [ ] Add screenshots of how it works and provide a solution for diferent paths:
  
  * [ ] Front End development
  * [ ] Full Stack development
  * [ ] Java
  * [ ] and etc.

  I think this stuff can grow into some kind of tooling for ease of setup and start development independent wether repository has this or not
